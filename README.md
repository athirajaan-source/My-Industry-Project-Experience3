Executive Revenue Intelligence Dashboard (Tata Group-Power BI)


Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes the company’s online retail transactions, including invoices, products, sales dates, prices, and quantities. The goal is to uncover patterns and performance indicators that support executive-level decision-making for both the CEO (revenue, growth, refunds) and CMO (customer behavior, product performance, seasonality).

The dashboard answers the most critical business questions and provides actionable strategies backed by data-driven insights.

Key Insights for CEO
Total Sales Revenue & Average Order Value (AOV) – 2011

Total revenue: $9.75M

Total orders: ~26K

AOV: $376 per order

Increasing AOV by 10% can unlock ~$1M additional revenue with no new customers.

Recommends upselling, cross-selling, product bundles, and loyalty rewards.

Highest Revenue-Generating Products

Top 5 products contribute only 7.3% of total revenue → highly diversified revenue base.

Product DOT leads with $206,245 revenue.

Insights suggest promoting top products or identifying high-value long-tail items.

Revenue Growth Over Time

Q1 → Q2 growth: 12% ($1.7M → $1.9M)

Expected year-end revenue +$400K above forecast if trend continues.

Q4 grew dramatically from 2010 → 2011 (328% YoY).

Refund / Return Impact

Refunds cost the company $897K (~9.2%).

Net revenue = $8.85M, not $9.75M.

Strong need to analyze:

High-return products

Regions with quality issues

Delivery-related complaints

Key Insights for CMO
