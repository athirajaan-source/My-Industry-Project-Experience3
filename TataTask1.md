I analyzed the company’s online retail transactions (invoices, products, sales dates, prices, and quantities) to uncover insights that can guide both strategic (CEO) and marketing (CMO) decisions. The following are the four most critical questions and answers derived from this analysis:



**Questions and Answers for CEO**





**What is our total sales revenue and average order value in 2011?**



Answers:



“We generated $9.75M revenue across nearly 26K orders this year.”



“Our average customer spends $376 per order, showing strong ticket size vs. industry.”



“If we increase AOV by just 10%, we unlock nearly $1M more in revenue without acquiring new customers.”



“We should focus on upsell, cross-sell strategies, bundles, and loyalty programs to drive this growth.”



**Which products generate the highest revenue?**



Answers:



The top 5 products contribute only ~7.3% of total revenue.



This means revenue is spread across many products (no single product dominates).



Strategy: The company may want to promote or bundle these top products to lift their share, OR identify hidden “long-tail” products that collectively drive most sales.



Product DOT leading at $206,245.



**Are sales growing over time?**



Answers:



“We’ve grown sales by 12% from Q1 to Q2 ($1.7M → $1.9M).”



“If this trajectory continues, we’ll close the year ~$400K above current forecasts.”



“Our Q4 sales grew from $0.7M in 2010 to $3M in 2011, a 328% increase.

*(Year-over-year data is unavailable from Q1-Q3 for comparison)*



**What is our return/refund rate?**



Answers:



“We achieved $9M revenue, but lost $897K (9.2%) to refunds.”



“This is almost a full month’s sales wiped out by returns.”



“Our net sales after refunds is $8.85M, not $9.75M.”



“Next steps: Identify top refunded products and regions, investigate quality/delivery issues, and launch a return-reduction initiative.”





**Questions and Answers for CMO** 



**Which products are the most popular (high quantity sold)?**



Answers:



“Product 23843 is our most popular item with 80,995 units sold yielding revenue of $168,469.60”



“This product can be positioned as a traffic driver in marketing campaigns.”



“We should explore bundling and upselling opportunities and check margin contribution — ensuring it not only drives volume but also profit.”



“Customer purchase behavior for this product can guide us in building targeted promotions and loyalty campaigns.”



**Do we see seasonal buying patterns?**





Answers:



“Sales grew steadily through the year from $1.7M in Q1 to $3.7M in Q4.

Q4 growth of 54% vs Q3 confirms strong seasonal demand.

Marketing should prioritize Q4 campaigns, inventory planning, and bundling strategies to maximize revenue, while using insights from Q3/Q4 to improve sales in Q1/Q2.”



**What is the repeat purchase trend?**



Answers:



“Our repeat purchase rate is stable at ~31–32%, meaning about 1 in 3 customers return each month.

Slight dips in Feb (31%) and Apr (30%) indicate months where engagement could be improved.

Marketing should focus on re-engaging one-time buyers, running loyalty campaigns, and leveraging repeat-purchase drivers to increase customer lifetime value.”



**What is the average basket size?**



Answers:



“Our average basket size is ~199 items per order, indicating that we serve mostly bulk buyers.

Marketing should focus on retention of high-volume customers, while exploring strategies to increase order frequency for smaller buyers.”
